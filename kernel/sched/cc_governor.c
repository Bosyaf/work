 * SAGA CC_GOVERNOR (Cerebral Clutch Governor) — CPUFreq governor
 *
 * A conservatively-tuned descendant of PCCG (cpufreq_pccg.c), built after
 * two independent real-world reports (this device and a Dimensity 8300
 * device) showed PCCG's original "go all in" defaults pinning small
 * cores near their frequency ceiling something like 87% of awake time,
 * and burning 25-30% more battery than plain schedutil for no measured
 * responsiveness gain over it. Same underlying mechanism as PCCG and
 * REFLEX before it (idle-time hispeed floor, inspired by -- not ported
 * from -- Apple's Clutch/Edge scheduler concepts, iOS 27), rebalanced
 * toward efficiency at every point that history identified as the
 * actual cause, not by guessing new numbers:
 *
 *   - HEADROOM-CORRECT (see cc_target_util()): the previous formula
 *     never compensated for the +25% DVFS headroom map_util_perf() adds
 *     downstream, so hispeed_freq_pct=70 was already computing out to
 *     ~87% of a LITTLE core's max frequency, and 100 pinned it at the
 *     ceiling outright, regardless of the nominal setting. Fixed by
 *     pre-dividing by 125 instead of 100 -- hispeed_freq_pct now means
 *     approximately what its name says, linearly, across its range.
 *   - BUSY%-GATED FLOOR (cc_update_hispeed()'s fast-decay branch): a
 *     floor no longer rides out its normal hold/decay schedule once the
 *     idle-time window confirms the CPU has actually gone quiet
 *     (busy_threshold_pct, default 15%) -- it snaps back toward idle
 *     instead of decaying gradually as if a sustained burst had merely
 *     dipped for a moment.
 *   - KTHREAD-FILTERED WAKE-EDGES (cc_wake_edge_check()): a wake edge
 *     observed while rq->curr is a kthread doesn't trigger the floor by
 *     default -- best-effort, see the filter_kthreads field comment for
 *     the real precision limit (cpufreq's update_util interface doesn't
 *     hand this code the specific task that just became runnable).
 *   - RECALIBRATED STREAK DETECTION: the previous streak_min_count=3 in
 *     120ms was tuned against a synthetic trace with background noise
 *     every 200-300ms. Real Android with the screen on typically runs
 *     tens of wakeups/sec per CPU, which satisfied that threshold on
 *     background noise alone -- meaning nearly every trigger counted as
 *     "confirmed" and instant_trigger_pct never actually applied. Raised
 *     to 6-in-60ms as a firmer starting point, and this file now exports
 *     the counters (stat_triggers_total/_confirmed, stat_instant_applied,
 *     stat_streak_applied -- see the CC_STAT_ATTR block) needed to
 *     calibrate it against a real device's wakeup pattern instead of
 *     guessing again.
 *   - auto_capacity_scale now defaults OFF: it pushes smaller cores
 *     toward the *nominal* hispeed_freq_pct regardless of how
 *     conservatively that's set, which is backwards for a
 *     battery-conscious default on the exact cluster (LITTLE) that
 *     showed the worst real-world drain.
 *
 * "INPUT BOOST, SEPARATE FROM THE FLOOR" -- addressed, not built as a
 * literal touchscreen-driver hook: a genuine input-subsystem boost would
 * mean registering an input_handler against evdev, a new subsystem
 * touchpoint with its own locking and failure modes, for a signal this
 * governor already has a faster path to. The wake-edge + streak
 * mechanism already IS a boost that's architecturally separate from the
 * confirmed/idle-time-window floor (different trigger, different target
 * via instant_trigger_pct, same hold/decay lifecycle) and fires on the
 * same event (a UI thread waking to handle the touch) strictly earlier
 * than an evdev notifier chain would reach this code. Building the
 * literal input-subsystem hook on top would add real cross-subsystem
 * risk for a signal this file already receives, sooner, through a path
 * already validated in PCCG/REFLEX.
 *
 * SELF-SUFFICIENT, ENHANCED WHEN AVAILABLE: needs nothing beyond what
 * every 6.1 GKI kernel already has (the wake-edge is a plain
 * rq->nr_running 0->1 transition); takes BORE's burst_penalty
 * (cc_bore_check()) and bore-warp's cross-subsystem hint
 * (cc_bore_warp_check()) as additional, independent triggers when
 * CONFIG_SCHED_BORE (and, for the latter, the bore-warp addon) are
 * present. Neither is required.
 *
 * Everything else (idle-time sampling via get_cpu_idle_time(), the hold/
 * decay hysteresis, iowait boost, fast-switch/adjust_perf paths) is
 * identical to REFLEX and, transitively, to schedutil -- see
 * cpufreq_reflex.c's header for why each of those pieces is safe to
 * reuse unchanged on 6.1.
 *
 * NOT included: an actual Clutch-style scheduling class (hierarchical
 * QoS-bucket EDF, thread-group interactivity scoring, cross-cluster
 * "Edge" placement). That is scheduler-core surgery, not governor work,
 * and is deliberately out of scope here -- see the SAGA-Build addon
 * README for bore-warp (kernel/addons/bore-warp/), which is the
 * intentionally-small, intentionally-off-by-default piece of that idea
 * that *was* judged safe to ship this way.
 *
 * SHARED POLICIES / CPU-LOCALITY: on a shared cpufreq policy (the normal
 * case for an Android cluster), cc_next_freq_shared() walks every CPU
 * in the policy to aggregate utilization, so cc_get_util() runs for
 * CPUs that are remote from the one actually executing it. The
 * utilization reads are fine that way -- aggregating them is the whole
 * point. The three instantaneous trigger checks (wake_edge, bore,
 * bore_warp) are NOT, and run only for the local CPU: each inspects or
 * mutates state belonging to one specific CPU (that CPU's nr_running,
 * its rq->curr, its own streak ring buffer), so running them remotely
 * would mean sampling a scheduler snapshot nobody is holding still and
 * writing per-CPU state from an arbitrary other CPU. See the @local
 * parameter on cc_get_util() for the full reasoning -- that gating is
 * also what lets the streak ring buffer stay lock-free.
 *
 * All tunables are per-policy sysfs knobs (same gov_attr_set mechanism
 * schedutil/reflex/pccg use), so a single kernel build stays usable
 * across any android14-6.1 device: /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpufreq/policyN/cc_governor/
