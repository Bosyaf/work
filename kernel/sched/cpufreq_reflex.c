 * SAGA REFLEX — CPUFreq governor
 *
 * Fork of cpufreq_schedutil.c (Copyright (C) 2016 Intel Corp, Rafael J.
 * Wysocki) with an added "hispeed floor": a real, measured busy% derived
 * from get_cpu_idle_time() (the same idle-time accounting cpufreq_governor.c
 * already uses for ondemand/conservative on every ARM/Android device) is
 * blended on top of the normal PELT-driven utilization, so a CPU that goes
 * from idle to genuinely busy jumps toward a high floor immediately instead
 * of waiting for PELT's ~32ms ramp-up. The floor then decays geometrically
 * over a handful of windows, handing control back to plain PELT scaling.
 *
 * This is a from-scratch reimplementation for the android14-6.1 GKI tree,
 * written against 6.1's real cpufreq/scheduler internals only:
 *   - effective_cpu_util() / cpu_bw_dl() / arch_scale_cpu_capacity() for the
 *     PELT side (identical to what schedutil already does — untouched).
 *   - get_cpu_idle_time() (drivers/cpufreq/cpufreq.c, EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL,
 *     NOHZ-aware with a jiffy fallback) for the hispeed side, instead of the
 *     sched_ext-era helper functions (scx_switched_all(), sugov_effective_
 *     cpu_perf(), uclamp capping refactors, etc.) that upstream Reflex
 *     v0.3.3 depends on — none of which exist pre-6.12. Every symbol this
 *     file touches already exists, unexported, inside this same 6.1 tree.
 *
 * All tunables are per-policy sysfs knobs (same gov_attr_set mechanism
 * schedutil uses for rate_limit_us), so a single kernel build stays usable
 * across any android14-6.1 device: defaults below are chosen conservatively
 * for a mobile SoC in general, but every number can be re-tuned per cluster
 * at runtime — e.g. on a Dimensity 7300 (2 Cortex-A78 perf + 6 Cortex-A55
 * eff, two independent cpufreq policies) the perf and eff clusters will
 * each get their own /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpufreq/policyN/reflex/ dir.
